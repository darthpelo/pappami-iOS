pappami-iOS
===========

[Pappa-Mi] (http://www.pappa-mi.it) native [iOS application] (https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/pappami/id673122977?mt=8). With this application parents can give opinions on the quality of the meals provided in school meals for their children.
I have developed this application for my friend Roberto Previtera, the creator of website [Pappa-Mi] (http://www.pappa-mi.it).
This first version was produced in a short time, in order to participate in the contest [App4Mi] (http://www.app4mi.it/) made ​​by the city of Milan.
To speed up as much as possible the development of this first version, I used the [UI Templates] (http://www.appdesignvault.com/iphone-flat-ui-design-patterns/) by *App Design Vault*.

**All Pappa-Mi project is Open Source (web, iOS native app, mobile web app) so if you want help us, your welcome :-)**

If you wont to user NewRelic and Crittercism frameworks, remeber to add your APIKEY and update *Framework Search Path* and *Library Search Path* in Build Settings.

Update
--------

**Removed VeespoFramework: 
The links between the project and framework created by Xcode are not reported correctly in git (local link). If a user clones the project fails to compile because of these errors. 
As for the open source project, the presence of the framework is not critical, I decided to remove it from the master branch.**
