pappami-iOS
===========

[Pappa-Mi] (http://www.pappa-mi.it) native iOS application (only iPhone).

I have developed this application for my friend Roberto Previtera, the creator of website [Pappa-Mi] (http://www.pappa-mi.it).
This first version was produced in a short time, in order to participate in the contest [App4Mi] (http://www.app4mi.it/) made ​​by the city of Milan.
